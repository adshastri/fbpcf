this is a simple first line
this is a second line that is intended to be longer than a line that can fit in a single buffer
this is a third line that should take at least three iterations of the buffer so that we can properly check the iterative functionality

we also test a blank line and
a line that will include a newline

finally, we want to test a really long block of
text, that will take 3 or 4 chunks, but this time
using the read API instead of the readLine API to
make sure that we have adequate test coverage. the
total size of this paragraph is 242 bytes.
